# Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe - Personal Notes

## Core Rules (from Allan Goff's paper)

### 1. Quantum Moves
- Each player places their mark in TWO squares simultaneously
- The mark exists in superposition (both squares at once)
- Notation: X1, X2, O1, O2, etc.

### 2. Entanglement
- When two moves share a square, they become entangled
- Example: X1 in [0,4] and O1 in [4,8] are entangled at square 4

### 3. Cycles and Collapse
- A cycle = closed loop of entanglements (A→B→C→A)
- When a cycle forms, ALL entangled moves must collapse
- The player who CREATED the cycle = the one who made the last move completing the loop
- The OTHER player (who didn't create the cycle) CHOOSES how to collapse

### 4. Winning
- Only CLASSICAL (collapsed) marks count for winning
- Need 3 classical marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)
- Winner determined AFTER collapse, not by who chose collapse

## Important Clarifications

### Why the cycle creator might still win:
1. Collapse options are LIMITED by original quantum positions
2. O can only choose from VALID configurations
3. Sometimes all valid options still result in the cycle creator winning

### Example:
- X creates cycle
- O chooses collapse from available options
- All moves collapse simultaneously
- Board is checked for winner
- X might still have 3 in a row despite O choosing the configuration

## Test Scenarios

### Cycle Creation Test:
1. X1: (0, 4)
2. O1: (4, 8) - entangled with X1 at 4
3. X2: (8, 0) - entangled with O1 at 8 AND X1 at 0 = CYCLE!
Result: X created cycle, O chooses collapse

### Draw Test:
[Add your own test scenario here after experimenting]

## Questions to Explore with Pen & Paper

1. Map out all entanglements in a game
2. Trace which move completes a cycle
3. List all valid collapse options
4. See why certain configurations are unavoidable

## Technical Implementation Notes

- Frontend (React) displays quantum states
- Backend (Python/Qiskit) handles quantum logic
- API communication for moves and collapse
- State synchronization is critical
