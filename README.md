# Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe

A quantum computing educational tool that brings quantum mechanics concepts to life through an interactive game.



## About

This graduation project implements **Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe** based on Allan Goff's research paper, demonstrating real quantum computing concepts:
- **Superposition**: Moves exist in multiple positions simultaneously
- **Entanglement**: Connected quantum states
- **Measurement/Collapse**: Quantum states resolving to classical positions

**Educational Purpose**: Help students understand quantum mechanics through interactive gameplay.

## Features

### Quantum Mechanics Implementation
- Real quantum circuits using IBM's Qiskit framework
- Hadamard gates for superposition
- Quantum measurement and collapse
- Entanglement detection and visualization

### Game Features
- Interactive web-based interface
- Visual quantum state representation
- Player-controlled collapse mechanism
- Real-time game statistics
- Winner detection and draw handling

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React.js 19.1.1
- Custom CSS with responsive design
- Modern React Hooks

**Backend:**
- Python 3.8+
- FastAPI for REST API
- Qiskit 0.45.0 (IBM Quantum Framework)
- Qiskit Aer Simulator

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have:

```bash
# Check Node.js version (should be 14+)
node --version

# Check Python version (should be 3.8+)
python --version

# Check npm
npm --version
```

## Installation & Setup

### 1️Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Maramjamaan/quantum-tic-tac-toeV2.git
cd quantum-tic-tac-toeV2
```

### Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
cd python
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..
```

## Running the Application

You need **TWO terminals** running simultaneously:

### Terminal 1: Start Backend (Python API)

```bash
cd python
python api.py
```

  Backend will run on: `http://localhost:8000`  
  API docs available at: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Terminal 2: Start Frontend (React App)

```bash
npm start
```

  Frontend will run on: `http://localhost:3000`  
  Browser will open automatically

## How to Play

### Basic Gameplay

1. **Make Quantum Moves**: Click 2 squares to place your mark in both simultaneously
2. **Create Entanglements**: When moves share squares, they become entangled
3. **Trigger Collapse**: When entanglements form a cycle, choose how to collapse
4. **Win the Game**: Get 3 classical (collapsed) marks in a row

### Game Rules

- Each player places quantum moves in **2 squares** at once
- Moves sharing squares become **entangled**
- Cycles in the entanglement graph trigger **collapse**
- The player who creates a cycle gives their opponent **control of the collapse**
- Only **classical marks** (after collapse) count for winning
- Game ends in a **draw** if less than 2 squares remain available

## Quantum Concepts Explained

### Superposition (التراكب الكمي)
Your move exists in **two squares simultaneously** until measured. Just like Schrödinger's cat being both alive and dead until observed.

**In the game**: When you select squares 0 and 4, your mark `X1` is in both positions at once.

### Entanglement (التشابك الكمي)
When two quantum moves share a square, they become **connected**. Measuring one affects the other.

**In the game**: If `X1` is in [0,4] and `O1` is in [4,8], they're entangled at square 4.

### Collapse (الانهيار الكمي)
Quantum states resolve to definite classical positions.

**In the game**: When a cycle forms, you choose where each move collapses to.

### Cyclic Entanglement (التشابك الدائري)
When entanglements form a closed loop, forcing collapse.

**In the game**: X1→O1→X2→X1 creates a cycle, triggering collapse.

##  Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

-  Game starts with Player X
-  Can select 2 squares for quantum moves
-  Quantum moves appear in both squares
-  Entanglement detected when squares shared
-  Cycle detection works
-  Collapse options appear
-  Winner detection works (3 in a row)
-  Draw detection works (board full)
-  Draw detection works (< 2 squares available)
-  Reset game works

### Run Backend Tests

```bash
cd python
python quantum_game.py
```

Expected output: Test scenarios with cycle detection and collapse.

## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
cd python
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall
```

### Frontend won't start
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### CORS Error
Make sure backend is running on `http://localhost:8000`

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Kill process on port 8000 (Backend)
# Windows:
netstat -ano | findstr :8000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Mac/Linux:
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9
```
